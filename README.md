# Iris_decission_tree ðŸŒ¸ðŸ’®ðŸª·

Predicting  flowers based on their unique characteristics using decision tree.

## The dataset used in the notebook is directly imported using sklearn.You can head over to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris">Iris Species</a> to get the dataset.


It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

- Id
- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm
- Species

The <a href = "Assignment.ipynb">notebook</a> represents all the steps whie creating the decission tree , while the <a href = "iris_dt.pdf">Iris Pdf</a> provides a visual representaion of tree.
